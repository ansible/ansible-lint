CMD: ansible-lint -f pep8 -x fqcn-builtins

RC: 2

STDERR:
WARNING  Loading custom .yamllint.yml config file, this extends our internal yamllint config.
WARNING  Listing 5 violation(s) that are fatal
You can skip specific rules or tags by adding them to your configuration file:
# .config/ansible-lint.yml
warn_list:  # or 'skip_list' to silence them completely
  - experimental  # all rules tagged as experimental
  - schema  # Perform JSON Schema Validation for known lintable kinds.

    Returned errors will not include exact line numbers, but they will mention
    the schema name being used as a tag, like ``playbook-schema``,
    ``tasks-schema``.

    This rule is not skippable and stops further processing of the file.

    Schema bugs should be reported towards https://github.com/ansible/schemas
    project instead of ansible-lint.

    If incorrect schema was picked, you might want to either:

    * move the file to standard location, so its file is detected correctly.
    * use ``kinds:`` option in linter config to help it pick correct file type.
