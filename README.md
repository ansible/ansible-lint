# Ansible-lint

`ansible-lint` checks playbooks for practices and behavior that could
potentially be improved. As a community-backed project ansible-lint supports
only the last two major versions of Ansible.

# Using ansible-lint as a GitHub Action

This action allows you to run `ansible-lint` on your codebase without having to
install it yourself.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ansible-lint.yml
name: ansible-lint
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main", "stable", "release/v*"]
jobs:
  build:
    name: Ansible Lint # Naming the build is important to use it as a status check
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run ansible-lint
        uses: ansible/ansible-lint@main # or version tag instead of 'main'
```
