Contributing to Ansible-lint
============================

To contribute to ansible-lint, please use pull requests on a branch
of your own fork.

After `creating your fork on GitHub`_, you can do:

.. code-block:: shell-session

   $ git clone git@github.com:yourname/ansible-lint
   $ cd ansible-lint
   $ git checkout -b your-branch-name
   # DO SOME CODING HERE
   $ git add your new files
   $ git commit -v
   $ git push origin your-branch-name

You will then be able to create a pull request from your commit.

All fixes to core functionality (i.e. anything except docs or examples)
should be accompanied by tests that fail prior to your change and
succeed afterwards.

Feel free to raise issues in the repo if you feel unable to
contribute a code fix.
