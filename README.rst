Command Line Options
--------------------

The following is the output from ``ansible-lint --help``, providing an overview of the basic command line options:

.. code-block:: bash

    Usage: ansible-lint playbook.yml|roledirectory ...

    Options:
      --version             show program's version number and exit
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -L                    list all the rules
      -q                    quieter, although not silent output
      -p                    parseable output in the format of pep8
      -r RULESDIR           specify one or more rules directories using one or
                            more -r arguments. Any -r flags override the default
                            rules in ['/path/to/ansible-
                            lint/lib/ansiblelint/rules'], unless -R is also used.
      -R                    Use default rules ['/path/to/ansible-
                            lint/lib/ansiblelint/rules'] in addition to any extra
                            rules directories specified with -r. There is no need
                            to specify this if no -r flags are used
      -t TAGS               only check rules whose id/tags match these values
      -T                    list all the tags
      -x SKIP_LIST          only check rules whose id/tags do not match these
                            values
      --exclude=EXCLUDE_PATHS
                            path to directories or files to skip. This option is
                            repeatable.
      --force-color         Try force colored output (relying on ansible's code)
      --nocolor             disable colored output
      -c /path/to/file      Specify configuration file to use.  Defaults to
                              ".ansible-lint"



Linting Playbooks and Roles
---------------------------

It's important to note that ``ansible-lint`` accepts a list of Ansible playbook files or a list of role directories. Starting from a directory that contains the following, the playbook file, ``playbook.yml``, or one of the role subdirectories, such as ``geerlingguy.apache``, can be passed:

.. code-block:: bash

  playbook.yml
  roles/
      geerlingguy.apache/
          tasks/
          handlers/
          files/
          templates/
          vars/
          defaults/
          meta/
      geerlingguy.elasticsearch/
          tasks/
          handlers/
          files/
          templates/
          vars/
          defaults/
          meta/

The following lints the role ``geerlingguy.apache``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ansible-lint geerlingguy.apache

    [ANSIBLE0013] Use shell only when shell functionality is required
    /Users/chouseknecht/.ansible/roles/geerlingguy.apache/tasks/main.yml:19
    Task/Handler: Get installed version of Apache.

    [ANSIBLE0011] All tasks should be named
    /Users/chouseknecht/.ansible/roles/geerlingguy.apache/tasks/main.yml:29
    Task/Handler: include_vars apache-22.yml

    [ANSIBLE0011] All tasks should be named
    /Users/chouseknecht/.ansible/roles/geerlingguy.apache/tasks/main.yml:32
    Task/Handler: include_vars apache-24.yml

Here's the contents of ``playbook.yml``, which references multiples roles:

.. code-block:: yaml

  - name: Lint multiple roles
    hosts: all
    tasks:

    - include_role:
      name: geerlingguy.apache

    - include_role:
      name: geerlingguy.elasticsearch

The following lints ``playbook.yml``, which evaluates both the playbook and the referenced roles:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ansible-lint playbook.yml

    [ANSIBLE0013] Use shell only when shell functionality is required
    /Users/chouseknecht/roles/geerlingguy.apache/tasks/main.yml:19
    Task/Handler: Get installed version of Apache.

    [ANSIBLE0011] All tasks should be named
    /Users/chouseknecht/roles/geerlingguy.apache/tasks/main.yml:29
    Task/Handler: include_vars apache-22.yml

    [ANSIBLE0011] All tasks should be named
    /Users/chouseknecht/roles/geerlingguy.apache/tasks/main.yml:32
    Task/Handler: include_vars apache-24.yml

    [ANSIBLE0011] All tasks should be named
    /Users/chouseknecht/roles/geerlingguy.elasticsearch/tasks/main.yml:17
    Task/Handler: service state=started name=elasticsearch enabled=yes

Since ``ansible-lint`` accepts a list of roles or playbooks, the following works as well, producing the same output as the example above:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ansible-lint geerlingguy.apache geerlingguy.elasticsearch

    [ANSIBLE0013] Use shell only when shell functionality is required
    /Users/chouseknecht/roles/geerlingguy.apache/tasks/main.yml:19
    Task/Handler: Get installed version of Apache.

    [ANSIBLE0011] All tasks should be named
    /Users/chouseknecht/roles/geerlingguy.apache/tasks/main.yml:29
    Task/Handler: include_vars apache-22.yml

    [ANSIBLE0011] All tasks should be named
    /Users/chouseknecht/roles/geerlingguy.apache/tasks/main.yml:32
    Task/Handler: include_vars apache-24.yml

    [ANSIBLE0011] All tasks should be named
    /Users/chouseknecht/roles/geerlingguy.elasticsearch/tasks/main.yml:17
    Task/Handler: service state=started name=elasticsearch enabled=yes

Examples
--------

Included in ``ansible-lint/examples`` are some example playbooks with undesirable features. Running ansible-lint on them works, as demonstrated in the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ansible-lint examples/example.yml

    [ANSIBLE0004] Git checkouts must contain explicit version
    examples/example.yml:15
    Task/Handler: git check

    [ANSIBLE0004] Git checkouts must contain explicit version
    examples/example.yml:18
    Task/Handler: git check 2

    [ANSIBLE0004] Git checkouts must contain explicit version
    examples/example.yml:30
    Task/Handler: using git module

    [ANSIBLE0002] Trailing whitespace
    examples/example.yml:13
        action: do nothing   

    [ANSIBLE0002] Trailing whitespace
    examples/example.yml:35
        with_items: 

    [ANSIBLE0006] git used in place of git module
    examples/example.yml:24
    Task/Handler: executing git through command

    [ANSIBLE0006] git used in place of git module
    examples/example.yml:27
    Task/Handler: executing git through command

    [ANSIBLE0006] git used in place of git module
    examples/example.yml:30
    Task/Handler: executing git through command
    If playbooks include other playbooks, or tasks, or handlers or roles, these are also handled:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ bin/ansible-lint examples/include.yml

    [ANSIBLE0004] Checkouts must contain explicit version
    /Users/will/src/ansible-lint/examples/roles/bobbins/tasks/main.yml:3
    action: git a=b c=d

Configuring
===========

.. configuring-docs-inclusion-marker-do-not-remove

Configuration File
------------------

Ansible-lint supports local configuration via a ``.ansible-lint`` configuration file. Ansible-lint checks the working directory for the presence of this file and applies any configuration found there. The configuration file location can also be overridden via the ``-c path/to/file`` CLI flag.

If a value is provided on both the command line and via a config file, the values will be merged (if a list like **exclude_paths**), or the **True** value will be preferred, in the case of something like **quiet**.

The following values are supported, and function identically to their CLI counterparts:

.. code-block:: yaml

    exclude_paths:
      - ./my/excluded/directory/
      - ./my/other/excluded/directory/
      - ./last/excluded/directory/
    parseable: true
    quiet: true
    rulesdir:
      - ./rule/directory/
    skip_list:
      - skip_this_tag
      - and_this_one_too
      - skip_this_id
      - '401'
    tags:
      - run_this_tag
    use_default_rules: true
    verbosity: 1


Pre-commit Setup
----------------

To use ansible-lint with `pre-commit`_, just add the following to your local repo's ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` file. Make sure to change **sha:** to be either a git commit sha or tag of ansible-lint containing ``hooks.yaml``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    - repo: https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint.git
      sha: v3.3.1
      hooks:
        - id: ansible-lint
          files: \.(yaml|yml)$

.. configuring-docs-inclusion-marker-end-do-not-remove

Rules
=====

.. rules-docs-inclusion-marker-do-not-remove

Specifying Rules at Runtime
---------------------------

By default, ``ansible-lint`` uses the rules found in ``ansible-lint/lib/ansiblelint/rules``. To override this behavior and use a custom set of rules, use the ``-r /path/to/custom-rules`` option to provide a directory path containing the custom rules. For multiple rule sets, pass multiple ``-r`` options.

It's also possilbe to use the default rules, plus custom rules. This can be done by passing the ``-R`` to indicate that the deault rules are to be used, along with one or more ``-r`` options.

Using Tags to Include Rules
```````````````````````````

Each rule has an associated set of one or more tags. To view the list of tags for each available rule, use the ``-T`` option.

The following shows the available tags in an example set of rules, and the rules associated with each tag:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ansible-lint -v -T

    behaviour ['[ANSIBLE0016]']
    bug ['[ANSIBLE0014]']
    deprecated ['[ANSIBLE0015]', '[ANSIBLE0008]', '[ANSIBLE0018]', '[ANSIBLE0019]']
    formatting ['[ANSIBLE0015]', '[ANSIBLE0002]', '[ANSIBLE0009]']
    idempotency ['[ANSIBLE0012]']
    oddity ['[ANSIBLE0017]']
    readability ['[ANSIBLE0011]']
    repeatability ['[ANSIBLE0004]', '[ANSIBLE0010]', '[ANSIBLE0005]']
    resources ['[ANSIBLE0007]', '[ANSIBLE0006]']
    safety ['[ANSIBLE0013]']

To run just the *idempotency* rules, for example, run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ansible-lint -t idempotency playbook.yml

Excluding Rules
```````````````

To exclude rules from the available set of rules, use the ``-x SKIP_LIST`` option. For example, the following runs all of the rules except those with the tags *readability* and *safety*:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ansible-lint -x readability,safety playbook.yml

It's also possible to skip specific rules by passing the rule ID. For example, the following excludes rule *ANSIBLE0011*:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ansible-lint -x ANSIBLE0011 playbook.yml

False Positives: Muting Ansible Lint Warnings
---------------------------------------------

Some rules are a bit of a rule of thumb. Advanced *git*, *yum* or *apt* usage, for example, is typically difficult to achieve through the modules. In this case, you should mark the task so that warnings aren't produced.

There are two mechanisms for this - one works with all tasks, the other works with the command checking modules.

Use the ``warn`` parameter with the *command* or *shell* module.

Use ``skip_ansible_lint`` tag with any task that should be skipped.

It's also a good practice to comment the reasons why a task is being skipped.

Here's an example playbook showing the two techniques for muting Ansible Lint warnings:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - name: this would typically fire CommandsInsteadOfArgumentRule
      command: warn=no chmod 644 X

    - name: this would typically fire CommandsInsteadOfModuleRule
      command: git pull --rebase
      args:
        warn: False

    - name: this would typically fire GitHasVersionRule
      git: src=/path/to/git/repo dest=checkout
      tags:
      - skip_ansible_lint

Creating Custom Rules
---------------------

Rules are described using a class file per rule. Default rules are named *DeprecatedVariableRule.py*, etc.

Each rule definition should have the following:

* ID: A unique identifier
* Short description: Brief description of the rule
* Description: Behaviour the rule is looking for
* Tags: one or more tags that may be used to include or exclude the rule
* At least one of the following methods:

  * ``match`` that takes a line and returns None or False, if the line doesn't match the test, and True or a custom message, when it does. (This allows one rule to test multiple behaviours - see e.g. the *CommandsInsteadOfModulesRule*.)
  * ``matchtask`` that operates on a single task or handler, such that tasks get standardized to always contain a *module* key and *module_arguments* key. Other common task modifiers, such as *when*, *with_items*, etc., are also available as keys, if present in the task.

An example rule using ``match`` is:

.. code-block:: python

    from ansiblelint import AnsibleLintRule

    class DeprecatedVariableRule(AnsibleLintRule):

        id = 'ANSIBLE0001'
        shortdesc = 'Deprecated variable declarations'
        description = 'Check for lines that have old style ${var} ' + \
                      'declarations'
        tags = { 'deprecated' }

        def match(self, file, line):
            return '${' in line

An example rule using ``matchtask`` is:

.. code-block:: python

    import ansiblelint.utils
    from ansiblelint import AnsibleLintRule

    class TaskHasTag(AnsibleLintRule):
        id = 'ANSIBLE0008'
        shortdesc = 'Tasks must have tag'
        description = 'Tasks must have tag'
        tags = ['productivity']

        def matchtask(self, file, task):
            # If the task include another task or make the playbook fail
            # Don't force to have a tag
            if not set(task.keys()).isdisjoint(['include','fail']):
                return False

            # Task should have tags
            if not task.has_key('tags'):
                  return True

        return False

The task argument to ``matchtask`` contains a number of keys - the critical one is *action*. The value of *task['action']* contains the module being used, and the arguments passed, both as key-value pairs and a list of other arguments (e.g. the command used with shell).

In ansible-lint 2.0.0, *task['action']['args']* was renamed *task['action']['module_arguments']* to avoid a clash when a module actually takes args as a parameter key (e.g. ec2_tag)

In ansible-lint 3.0.0 *task['action']['module']* was renamed *task['action']['__ansible_module__']* to avoid a clash when a module take module as an argument. As a precaution, *task['action']['module_arguments']* was renamed *task['action']['__ansible_arguments__']*.
