Licensing
=========

The code in the ansible-lint repository is licensed under the MIT_ license. If
you contribute to this repository, that license applies to your contributions.

The ansible-lint project also imports the Ansible python module, which is
licensed under the GPLv3_ license. Because of this import, the GPLv3_ rules
apply to the full distribution of ansible-lint. We maintain the MIT_ license on
the repository so we can fully use an MIT_ license in the future if we ever
remove the runtime dependency on Ansible code.

Installing the `ansible-lint` python package does not install any GPL
dependencies, all of them are listed as extras.
