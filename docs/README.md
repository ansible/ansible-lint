# Documentation source for Ansible Lint

To build the docs, run `tox -e docs`. At the end of the build, you will
see the local location of your built docs.

Building docs locally may not be identical to CI/CD builds. We recommend
you to create a draft PR and check the RTD PR preview page too.

If you do not want to learn the reStructuredText format, you can also [file an issue](https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-lint/issues), and let us know how we can improve our documentation.
