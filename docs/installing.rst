Installing on Windows is not supported because we use symlinks inside Python
packages.

While our project does not directly ship a container, the
tool is part of the toolset_ container.  Please avoid raising any bugs
related to containers and use the discussions_ forum instead.

.. code-block:: bash

    # replace docker with podman
    docker run -h toolset -it quay.io/ansible/toolset ansible-lint --version

.. _toolset: https://github.com/ansible-community/toolset
.. _discussions: https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-lint/discussions

.. note::

    The default installation of the ansible-lint package no longer installs any
    specific version of Ansible. You need to either install the desired version
    of Ansible yourself or mention one of the helper extras:

    * ``core`` - will install the latest version of ansible-core 2.11+
    * ``community`` - will install the latest version of ansible community edition

Using pip or pipx
-----------------

You can use either pip3_ or pipx_ to install it; the latter one
automatically isolates the linter from your current python environment.
That approach may avoid having to deal with particularities of installing
python packages, like creating a virtual environment, activating it, installing
using ``--user`` or fixing potential conflicts if not using virtualenvs.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Assuming you already installed Ansible and you also want the optional
    # yamllint support:
    pip3 install "ansible-lint[yamllint]"

    # If you want to install and use the latest Ansible (w/o community collections)
    pip3 install "ansible-lint[core,yamllint]"

    # If you want to install and use the latest Ansible with community collections
    pip3 install "ansible-lint[community,yamllint]"

    # If you want to install an older version of Ansible 2.9
    pip3 install ansible-lint "ansible>=2.9,<2.10"
