About Ansible Lint
``````````````````

Ansible Lint is a commandline tool for linting playbooks. Use it to detect
behaviors and practices that could potentially be improved.

The tool is used by the `Ansible Galaxy project <https://github.com/ansible/galaxy/>`_ to lint and calculate quality scores
for content contributed to the `Galaxy Hub <https://galaxy.ansible.com>`_.

The project was originally started by `@willthames <https://github.com/willthames/>`_, and has since been
transferred to the Ansible project team.
