# Documentation source for Ansible Lint

To build the docs, run `tox -e docs`. At the end of the build, you will
see the local location of your builded docs.

Building docs locally is not identical with CI/CD builds, so you
are advised to create a draft PR and check RTD job output.

If you do not want to learn the reStructuredText format, you can also [file an issue](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint/issues), and let us know how we can improve our documentation.
