# Installing the latest version of Ansible-lint

You can install the most recent version of Ansible-lint with the [pip3] or [pipx] Python package manager.
Use [pipx] to isolate Ansible-lint from your current Python environment as an alternative to creating a virtual environment.

```bash
# This also installs ansible-core if it is not already installed
pip3 install "ansible-lint"
```
