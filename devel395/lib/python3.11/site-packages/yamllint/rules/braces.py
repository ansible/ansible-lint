Use this rule to control the use of flow mappings or number of spaces inside
braces (``{`` and ``}``).

.. rubric:: Options

* ``forbid`` is used to forbid the use of flow mappings which are denoted by
  surrounding braces (``{`` and ``}``). Use ``true`` to forbid the use of flow
  mappings completely. Use ``non-empty`` to forbid the use of all flow
  mappings except for empty ones.
* ``min-spaces-inside`` defines the minimal number of spaces required inside
  braces.
* ``max-spaces-inside`` defines the maximal number of spaces allowed inside
  braces.
* ``min-spaces-inside-empty`` defines the minimal number of spaces required
  inside empty braces.
* ``max-spaces-inside-empty`` defines the maximal number of spaces allowed
  inside empty braces.
