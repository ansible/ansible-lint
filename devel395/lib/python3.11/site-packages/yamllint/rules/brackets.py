Use this rule to control the use of flow sequences or the number of spaces
inside brackets (``[`` and ``]``).

.. rubric:: Options

* ``forbid`` is used to forbid the use of flow sequences which are denoted by
  surrounding brackets (``[`` and ``]``). Use ``true`` to forbid the use of
  flow sequences completely. Use ``non-empty`` to forbid the use of all flow
  sequences except for empty ones.
* ``min-spaces-inside`` defines the minimal number of spaces required inside
  brackets.
* ``max-spaces-inside`` defines the maximal number of spaces allowed inside
  brackets.
* ``min-spaces-inside-empty`` defines the minimal number of spaces required
  inside empty brackets.
* ``max-spaces-inside-empty`` defines the maximal number of spaces allowed
  inside empty brackets.
