    Splits args on whitespace, but intelligently reassembles

    When used in a remote module, we won't ever have to be concerned about
    jinja2 blocks, however this function is/will be used in the
    core portions as well before the args are templated.

    example input: a=b c="foo bar"

    how Ansible needs to use it.
