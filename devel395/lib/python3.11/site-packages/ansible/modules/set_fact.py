module: set_fact
short_description: Set host variable(s) and fact(s).
version_added: "1.2"
description:
    - This action allows setting variables associated to the current host.
    - These variables will be available to subsequent plays during an ansible-playbook run via the host they were set on.
    - Set C(cacheable) to C(true) to save variables across executions using a fact cache.
      Variables will keep the set_fact precedence for the current run, but will used 'cached fact' precedence for subsequent ones.
    - Per the standard Ansible variable precedence rules, other types of variables have a higher priority, so this value may be overridden.
options:
  key_value:
    description:
      - "The C(set_fact) module takes C(key=value) pairs or C(key: value) (YAML notation) as variables to set in the playbook scope.
        The 'key' is the resulting variable name and the value is, of course, the value of said variable."
      - You can create multiple variables at once, by supplying multiple pairs, but do NOT mix notations.
    required: true
  cacheable:
    description:
      - This boolean converts the variable into an actual 'fact' which will also be added to the fact cache.
        It does not enable fact caching across runs, it just means it will work with it if already enabled.
      - Normally this module creates 'host level variables' and has much higher precedence, this option changes the nature and precedence
        (by 7 steps) of the variable created.
        U(https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html#variable-precedence-where-should-i-put-a-variable)
      - "This actually creates 2 copies of the variable, a normal 'set_fact' host variable with high precedence and
        a lower 'ansible_fact' one that is available for persistence via the facts cache plugin.
        This creates a possibly confusing interaction with C(meta: clear_facts) as it will remove the 'ansible_fact' but not the host variable."

attributes:
    action:
        details: While the action plugin does do some of the work it relies on the core engine to actually create the variables, that part cannot be overriden
        support: partial
    bypass_host_loop:
        support: none
    bypass_task_loop:
        support: none
    check_mode:
        support: full
    core:
        details: While parts of this action are implemented in core, other parts are still available as normal plugins and can be partially overridden
        support: partial
    delegation:
        details:
            - while variable assignment can be delegated to a different host the execution context is always the current inventory_hostname
            - connection variables, if set at all, would reflect the host it would target, even if we are not connecting at all in this case
        support: partial
    diff_mode:
        support: none
notes:
    - Because of the nature of tasks, set_fact will produce 'static' values for a variable.
      Unlike normal 'lazy' variables, the value gets evaluated and templated on assignment.
    - Some boolean values (yes, no, true, false) will always be converted to boolean type,
      unless C(DEFAULT_JINJA2_NATIVE) is enabled.  This is done so the C(var=value) booleans,
      otherwise it would only be able to create strings, but it also prevents using those values to create YAML strings.
      Using the setting will restrict k=v to strings, but will allow you to specify string or boolean in YAML.
    - "To create lists/arrays or dictionary/hashes use YAML notation C(var: [val1, val2])."
    - Since 'cacheable' is now a module param, 'cacheable' is no longer a valid fact name.
