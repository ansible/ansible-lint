module: raw
short_description: Executes a low-down and dirty command
version_added: historical
options:
  free_form:
    description:
      - The raw module takes a free form command to run.
      - There is no parameter actually named 'free form'; see the examples!
    required: true
  executable:
    description:
      - Change the shell used to execute the command. Should be an absolute path to the executable.
      - When using privilege escalation (C(become)) a default shell will be assigned if one is not provided
        as privilege escalation requires a shell.
    version_added: "1.0"
description:
     - Executes a low-down and dirty SSH command, not going through the module
       subsystem.
     - This is useful and should only be done in a few cases. A common
       case is installing C(python) on a system without python installed by default.
       Another is speaking to any devices such as
       routers that do not have any Python installed. In any other case, using
       the M(ansible.builtin.shell) or M(ansible.builtin.command) module is much more appropriate.
     - Arguments given to C(raw) are run directly through the configured remote shell.
     - Standard output, error output and return code are returned when
       available.
     - There is no change handler support for this module.
     - This module does not require python on the remote system, much like
       the M(ansible.builtin.script) module.
     - This module is also supported for Windows targets.

      support: full
notes:
    - "If using raw from a playbook, you may need to disable fact gathering
      using C(gather_facts: no) if you're using C(raw) to bootstrap python
      onto the machine."
    - If you want to execute a command securely and predictably, it may be
      better to use the M(ansible.builtin.command) or M(ansible.builtin.shell) modules instead.
    - The C(environment) keyword does not work with raw normally, it requires a shell
      which means it only works if C(executable) is set or using the module
      with privilege escalation (C(become)).
