module: script
version_added: "0.9"
short_description: Runs a local script on a remote node after transferring it
description:
  - The C(script) module takes the script name followed by a list of space-delimited arguments.
  - Either a free form command or C(cmd) parameter is required, see the examples.
  - The local script at path will be transferred to the remote node and then executed.
  - The given script will be processed through the shell environment on the remote node.
  - This module does not require python on the remote system, much like the M(ansible.builtin.raw) module.
  - This module is also supported for Windows targets.
options:
  free_form:
    description:
      - Path to the local script file followed by optional arguments.
  cmd:
    type: str
    description:
      - Path to the local script to run followed by optional arguments.
  creates:
    description:
      - A filename on the remote node, when it already exists, this step will B(not) be run.
    version_added: "1.5"
  removes:
    description:
      - A filename on the remote node, when it does not exist, this step will B(not) be run.
    version_added: "1.5"
  chdir:
    description:
      - Change into this directory on the remote node before running the script.
    version_added: "2.4"
  executable:
    description:
      - Name or path of a executable to invoke the script with.
    version_added: "2.6"
notes:
  - It is usually preferable to write Ansible modules rather than pushing scripts. Convert your script to an Ansible module for bonus points!
  - The C(ssh) connection plugin will force pseudo-tty allocation via C(-tt) when scripts are executed. Pseudo-ttys do not have a stderr channel and all
    stderr is sent to stdout. If you depend on separated stdout and stderr result keys, please switch to a copy+command set of tasks instead of using script.
  - If the path to the local script contains spaces, it needs to be quoted.
  - This module is also supported for Windows targets.

attributes:
    check_mode:
        support: partial
        details: while the script itself is arbitrary and cannot be subject to the check mode semantics it adds C(creates)/C(removes) options as a workaround

    platform:
        details: This action is one of the few that requires no Python on the remote as it passes the command directly into the connection string
