    action:
        details: While the action plugin does do some of the work it relies on the core engine to actually create the variables, that part cannot be overridden

        support: none
    bypass_task_loop:
        support: none

        support: full

notes:
    - In order for custom stats to be displayed, you must set C(show_custom_stats) in section C([defaults]) in C(ansible.cfg)
      or by defining environment variable C(ANSIBLE_SHOW_CUSTOM_STATS) to C(true). See the C(default) callback plugin for details.
