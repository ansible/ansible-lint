        :class:`TerminalBase` plugins are byte strings.  This is because of
        how close to the underlying platform these plugins operate.  Remember
        to mark literal strings as byte string (``b"string"``) and to use
        :func:`~ansible.module_utils._text.to_bytes` and
        :func:`~ansible.module_utils._text.to_text` to avoid unexpected
        problems.
