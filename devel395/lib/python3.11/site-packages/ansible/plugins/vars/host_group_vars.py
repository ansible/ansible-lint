    short_description: In charge of loading group_vars and host_vars
    requirements:
        - Enabled in configuration
    description:
        - Loads YAML vars into corresponding groups/hosts in group_vars/ and host_vars/ directories.
        - Files are restricted by extension to one of .yaml, .json, .yml or no extension.
        - Hidden (starting with '.') and backup (ending with '~') files and directories are ignored.
        - Only applies to inventory sources that are existing paths.
        - Starting in 2.10, this plugin requires enabling and is enabled by default.
