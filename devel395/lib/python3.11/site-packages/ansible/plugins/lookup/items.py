    description:
      - this lookup returns a list of items given to it, if any of the top level items is also a list it will flatten it, but it will not recurse
    notes:
      - this is the standard lookup used for loops in most examples
      - check out the 'flattened' lookup for recursive flattening
      - if you do not want flattening nor any other transformation look at the 'list' lookup.
