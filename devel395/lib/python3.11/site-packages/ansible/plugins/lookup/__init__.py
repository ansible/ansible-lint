        When the playbook specifies a lookup, this method is run.  The
        arguments to the lookup become the arguments to this method.  One
        additional keyword argument named ``variables`` is added to the method
        call.  It contains the variables available to ansible at the time the
        lookup is templated.  For instance::

            "{{ lookup('url', 'https://toshio.fedorapeople.org/one.txt', validate_certs=True) }}"

        would end up calling the lookup plugin named url's run method like this::
            run(['https://toshio.fedorapeople.org/one.txt'], variables=available_variables, validate_certs=True)

        Lookup plugins can be used within playbooks for looping.  When this
        happens, the first argument is a list containing the terms.  Lookup
        plugins can also be called from within playbooks to return their
        values into a variable or parameter.  If the user passes a string in
        this case, it is converted into a list.

        Errors encountered during execution should be returned by raising
        AnsibleError() with a message describing the error.

        Any strings returned by this method that could ever contain non-ascii
        must be converted into python's unicode type as the strings will be run
        through jinja2 which has this requirement.  You can use::

            from ansible.module_utils._text import to_text
            result_string = to_text(result_string)
