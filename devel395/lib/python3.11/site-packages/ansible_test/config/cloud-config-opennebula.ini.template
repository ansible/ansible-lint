# This is the configuration template for ansible-test OpenNebula integration tests.
#
# You do not need this template if you are:
#
# 1) Running integration tests without using ansible-test.
# 2) Running integration tests against previously recorded XMLRPC fixtures
#
# If you want to test against a Live OpenNebula platform,
# fill in the values below and save this file without the .template extension.
# This will cause ansible-test to use the given configuration.
#
# If you run with @FIXTURES enabled (true) then you can decide if you want to
# run in @REPLAY mode (true) or, record mode (false).
