# Sample ansible-test configuration file for collections.
# Support for this feature was first added in ansible-core 2.12.
# Use of this file is optional.
# If used, this file must be placed in "tests/config.yml" relative to the base of the collection.

modules:
  # Configuration for modules/module_utils.
  # These settings do not apply to other content in the collection.

  python_requires: default
  # Python versions supported by modules/module_utils.
  # This setting is required.
  #
  # Possible values:
  #
  #  - 'default'    - All Python versions supported by Ansible.
  #                   This is the default value if no configuration is provided.
  #  - 'controller' - All Python versions supported by the Ansible controller.
  #                   This indicates the modules/module_utils can only run on the controller.
  #                   Intended for use only with modules/module_utils that depend on ansible-connection, which only runs on the controller.
  #                   Unit tests for modules/module_utils will be permitted to import any Ansible code, instead of only module_utils.
  #  - SpecifierSet - A PEP 440 specifier set indicating the supported Python versions.
  #                   This is only needed when modules/module_utils do not support all Python versions supported by Ansible.
  #                   It is not necessary to exclude versions which Ansible does not support, as this will be done automatically.
  #
  # What does this affect?
  #
  #  - Unit tests will be skipped on any unsupported Python version.
  #  - Sanity tests that are Python version specific will be skipped on any unsupported Python version that is not supported by the controller.
  #
  # Sanity tests that are Python version specific will always be executed for Python versions supported by the controller, regardless of this setting.
  # Reasons for this restriction include, but are not limited to:
  #
  #  - AnsiballZ must be able to AST parse modules/module_utils on the controller, even though they may execute on a managed node.
  #  - ansible-doc must be able to AST parse modules/module_utils on the controller to display documentation.
  #  - ansible-test must be able to AST parse modules/module_utils to perform static analysis on them.
  #  - ansible-test must be able to execute portions of modules/module_utils to validate their argument specs.
  #
  # These settings only apply to modules/module_utils.
  # It is not possible to declare supported Python versions for controller-only code.
  # All Python versions supported by the controller must be supported by controller-only code.
